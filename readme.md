# Just + Kestrel = Jester

Basically .NET Core "Minimal API" is materalization of the philosopy of grown ups who took over the .net framework kindergarten, before .NET Core 1.0. 

Correction: they have been actually hired to save the whole  .NET. It the time sinking in the mud self made by the .net lemming kindergarten. 

No I am not making this up. I am juswt speculating :wink:

In here I am trying and commenting things made possible with the said "Minimal API".  The most interesting premised, I think I can make outm is: "do it in code". Write the code that does it. DO not waste time in C# OOP or in baroque over engineered extern json formated configurations.

Of course, they do not say it, they just do it that way. Everything is made as simple as simple can be.

### Small and fast web server is a foundation corner stone of modern Azure apps. aka "Cloud Native Solutions"

As an prime example, .NET grown ups have made the Kestrel. It is (very) fast. And, you can totaly control it writting C# code only. 

And then just dump the result in the Linux container running .NET Core dll's.
