# Just + Kestrel = Jester

Basically .NET Core "Minimal API" is the materialization of the philosophy of grown-ups who took over the .net framework kindergarten, before .NET Core 1.0. 

Correction: They have been actually hired to save the whole. NET. At the time sinking in the mud self-made by the .net lemming kindergarten. 

No, I am not making this up. I am just speculating :wink:

In here I am trying and commenting on things made possible with the said "Minimal API".  The most interesting premise, I think I can make out is: "Do it in code". Write the code that does it. Do not waste time in C# OOP or in baroque over-engineered extern JSON formatted configurations.

Of course, "they" do not say exactly this, they just do it that way. Everything is made as simple as simple can be.

### A small and fast web server is a foundation cornerstone of modern Azure apps. aka "Cloud Native Solutions"

As a prime example, .NET grown-ups have made the Kestrel. It is (very) fast. And, you can totally control it writing C# code only. 

And then just dump the result in the Linux container running .NET Core dlls.
